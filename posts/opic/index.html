                I think my room is very clean and modern. I love my room because it’s only for me. I can have a quiet moment all by myself without any distractions. Another reason is that since my bedroom has large windows, I can enjoy a breathtaking view and fresh air. When you walk into my room, you can see a bed. On the left, there is a dressing table. A desk is also the left. On the right is a bookself. I am very satisfied with my room.

                Well… I am very busy during the week, so I usually spend time with my family on weekends. We usually prepared dinner together at home. I help my mother cook and my brother does the dishes. While having our mead, we often talk about current events. After dinner, everyone relaxes. My house is very cozy, so we enjoy spending time there. My brother and I usually play video games together. My parents like to watch TV.

I also decided to get new furniture I bought a new couch and a matching chair. Finally I put up new curtains in the room. I am very happy with my living room now.
